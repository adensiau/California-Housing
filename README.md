# **🏠 California Housing Price Prediction**

**Description**

This project focuses on predicting California housing prices using machine learning. A regression model was trained on housing data to estimate median house values based on various features such as location, population, and income levels. The goal was to build an accurate and interpretable model for real estate price estimation.
