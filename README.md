# CaliforniaHousing

First Data Sciene project where we investigated the California Housing Data from the 1990 California census. The data described houses found in a given California block, which generally summarised location (longitude, latitude, ocean proximity), the general details of the houses in the block (total rooms, total bedrooms, number of households, median house value, median house age), and information relating to the people who live in the block (population, median income). The data was almost entirely numerical, however it did have one categorical variable that was ‘Ocean Proximity’. The overarching question the group posed was which variables had the largest impact on the median house value of a block. 

The techniques used in this project were very simple as most of the inquiries could be answered through general exploratory data analysis and simple regression models.
